# Quantum Hackathon CIT

<h3>Idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The quality of concrete is determined by its <b>Comprehensive Strength</b>, which is measured using a conventional Crush Test. <br>
  <li> It takes 28 days to test the strength, which is a long period. <br>
  <li> We can save a lot of time & effort by using Data Science methods to estimate raw materials needed to obtain required comprehensive strength.
</ul>
<h3>Features Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Cement (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Blast Furnace Slag (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Fly Ash (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Water (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> SuperPlasticizer (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Coarse Aggregate (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Fine Aggregate (kg in m3 mixture)
  <li> Age (Days)
</ul>
